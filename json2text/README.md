# json-to-natural-language-text
### This library generates natural text using key-values of a json object on the basis of consumer-defined template.

### sample_template.json & sample_module.py : 
Please refer to the sample_template as an example on how to generate custom template of your own.
Note : If your template makes use of custom functions to generate values for a field, add all those functions declared in the 
template in a .py module. Please refer - sample_module.py for the same.

### Finally, the template and module needs to be passed as parameters along with the json object, that requires json-to-text conversion.
